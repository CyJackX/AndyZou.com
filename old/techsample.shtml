    <h3>Finally, a good time to buy a 4k Monitor-Recorder?</h3>
    <br>
    
<p>What started as a review of the Video Devices PIX-E5 quickly became a look at the rapidly accelerating timeline of the 4k Monitor-Recorder market.  As the A7S and GH4 craze took off, more and more shooters began looking for the option to record 4k in higher quality formats like Prores (or beyond) while also being able to monitor their footage with all the tools of an external monitor.  While Convergent Design's Odyssey series used to be the only product on the market that could record 4k, it was soon joined by the Atomos Shogun and the Video Devices PIX-E series.

<p>When Video Device's PIX-E line was announced in April 2015, it presented the cheapest 4k monitor/recorder options at the time.  The PIX-E5, their 5" SDI and HDMI model, was $1395, and their cheaper HDMI-only PIX-E5H was only $1195.  The Odyssey 7Q+ was still $2295 whether or not you were getting the free 2x256GB SSD deal (which were $395 at the time), and the ability to use select non-proprietary SSDs was only added in a later firmware update.  The Atomos Shogun was $1995 with a "barebones" version coming in at $1695, and this wasn't counting the cost of SSDs, although, the Shogun was not limited to proprietary drives.  The most expensive of the PIX-E series was the larger 7" PIX-E7 at $1595, which was the only one at a pricepoint similar to the competing models.

<p>However, later in September, Atomos announced the Ninja Assassin for $1295, an HDMI-only version of the Shogun.  Then, in January 2016, Convergent Design declared a limited time 500$ price drop to take the Odyssey to $1795, with most places still offering at least 1 free proprietary 256GB SSD.  Almost a week later, Atomos dropped prices on the Shogun to $1495 and their Ninja Assassin down to $995.

<p>What used to be a fairly niche high-end market has benefited greatly from the increased competition.  There are now options for everyone from the budget-conscious producer who simply wants to record Prores to the high-end shooter that needs the Odyssey's wide variety of cinema RAW codecs.

<p>For those of you looking for a basic breakdown of the differences amongst the brands, the Odyssey is the most feature-heavy option.  But, at $1795 (after which it'll be $2295 again) and requiring very specific SSDs for use, it is not for those needing a cheap and easy setup.  For the price, however, you will get hardware that has been built by Convergent Design to accommodate firmware updates for years to come.  The OLED screen is incredibly accurate (it's also the same panel in the SmallHD DP7).  One only needs to see the plethora of SDI ports on the Odyssey to see that they mean business (there are 2 ins, 2 outs, and 2 bi-directional.  <a href="https://www.redsharknews.com/production/item/2877-4-odyssey-7qs-needed-for-canon-8k-cinema-eos-prototype" target="_blank">A prototype of the 8k Canon Camera used 4 Odyssey's to record its stream</a>).  The Odyssey is also capable of expanding the abilities of many cameras thru its variety of raw codecs (which aren't free).  For those with no price limit, the Odyssey presents the most possibilities, although with a free SSD (now worth $249) the price does become very competitive with the Shogun.

<p>The Shogun made a splash by being a slightly more affordable alternative to the Odyssey.  Similar in size at 7.1", the Shogun boasted a higher resolution of 1920x1080 to the Odyssey's 7.7" 1280x720.  The A7S and GH4 both contributed to the popularity of this recorder because budget-conscious shooters were looking for ways to capture the 4k output of those cameras in higher quality Prores or DNXHD (although the GH4 did offer h264 internal 4k).  Most complaints have been due to the glossiness of the screen and poor build quality, but reviews have generally been positive.<hr>

<p>Lastly, the PIX-E series comes from Video Devices, a video-focused offshoot of popular professional audio brand Sound Devices.  So far, these options have been praised for their rugged build quality as you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVgc3ghJzYk" target="_blank">this video where they run over one with a car</a>.  Beyond offering more compact 5" options, this line also offers hard buttons in addition to their 1920x1080 touchscreens, unlike the Shogun and Odyssey which only have touchscreens.  What is also attractive to buyers is that their recording media is not SSD but instead a propietary SpeedDrive.  A SpeedDrive enclosure can be bought for $49, and any mSata drive can then be installed into the SpeedDrive, allowing users to customize their drive sizes at a significantly cheaper price compared to SSDs.  Also, the SpeedDrive itself is built with a USB output, so there is no need to carry around additional disk readers, making the PIX-E the most compact setup.  Given that the brand parent is Sound Devices, they also sell an attachment which greatly expands the sound recording capabilities of the line.  My only complaint is that the scopes (vector, luma, waveform) appear as transparent overlays with some lag and pixelation, but that is okay because I don't usually need pixel-perfect instantaneous accuracy from scopes.

<p>All of these options have similar features that are practically required on any new monitor-recorders coming to market such as 3D LUT support, a variety of scopes, false colors, zebras, peaking, and various recording formats.  Each company has been doing a fantastic job of continually updating its firmware to add new features ranging from recording options to anamorphic desqueeze.  The Odyssey supports the most framerates, features, and inputs, while the PIX-E is mostly limited to a single SDI input and 4k up to 30FPS.  For the price, I'd recommend the 5" PIX-E5H if you don't anticipate ever needing SDI, because the build quality and price of media make it a very attractive option.  I personally haven't handled the Ninja Assassin, which is slightly cheaper, but the cost of SSDs and the bulk and plastic build quality may make it unattractive to some, especially those working with gimbals that need smaller setups like myself.  I wouldn't get the Odyssey unless I was pairing it with a high-end cinema camera, but at that point the cost would probably be negligible compared to the cost of the rest of the camera!

<p>In summary, things have been rapidly improving for consumers looking for a 4k recorder-monitor.  Whether you're looking to bump up to 10bit recording or just to bypass internal codecs, there's a good selection that should continue to improve.
